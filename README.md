# Just Build Something

[![Just Build Something](https://img.shields.io/badge/just-build_something-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/therebelrobot/justbuildsomething) [![WTFPL-2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-WTFPL--2.0-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://tldrlegal.com/license/do-wtf-you-want-to-public-license-v2-(wtfpl-2.0))

Finding projects to test new languages/frameworks out on can be a challenge sometimes. I'm pulling together a community-curated (*that means you!*) list of small projects that can be used to play with new tech, show off your skills, or just kill some time. 

All ideas here are released for whatever you like under the [WTFPL-2.0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/do-wtf-you-want-to-public-license-v2-(wtfpl-2.0)) License. Roll the next release of your library with it! Build the next big startup with it! Take over Westeros with it! If you'd like to show some love, if you include a [badge](#badge) in your readme I'll [list your application here](#successful-builds).

## Contribution

As I said above, I want this to be a *community-curated* project, so I need your ideas! Or your hate mail! or anything, really! Open up a [Github Issue](https://github.com/therebelrobot/justbuildsomething/issues/new) here, or tweet me [@therebelrobot](https://twitter.com/therebelrobot) and we'll discuss getting your idea on the list.
