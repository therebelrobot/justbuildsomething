# Just Build Something

Finding projects to test new languages/frameworks out on can be a challenge sometimes. I'm pulling together a community-curated (*that means you!*) list of small projects that can be used to play with new tech, show off your skills, or just kill some time. 

All ideas here are released for whatever you like under the [WTFPL-2.0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/do-wtf-you-want-to-public-license-v2-(wtfpl-2.0)) License. Build the next big startup with it! Or integrate it into your new library! Or take over the solar system with it!

As I said above, I want this to be a *community-curated* project, so I need your ideas! Or your hate mail! or anything, really! Open up a Github Issue here, or tweet me [@therebelrobot](https://twitter.com/therebelrobot) and we'll discuss getting your idea on the list.
