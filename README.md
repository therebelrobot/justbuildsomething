Finding projects to test new languages/frameworks out on can be a challenge sometimes. I'm pulling together a community-curated (*that means you!*) list of small projects that can be used to play with new tech, show off your skills, or just kill some time. What you see is curated from [various sources](#sources), so if you like an idea, hop over to their site and give them some love!

This project is released under the [WTFPL-2.0](https://tldrlegal.com/license/do-wtf-you-want-to-public-license-v2-(wtfpl-2.0)) License. Roll the next release of your library with it! Build the next big startup with it! Take over Westeros with it! If you'd like to show some love, if you include a [badge](#badge) in your readme I'll [list your application here](#successful-builds).
